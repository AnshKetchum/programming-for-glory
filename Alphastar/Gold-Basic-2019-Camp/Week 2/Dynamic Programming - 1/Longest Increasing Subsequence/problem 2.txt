==============================

Given a sequence of N numbers (0 < N <= 20,000) find the size of 
the longest increasing subsequence.

PROBLEM NAME: lis

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: One integer, N

* Line 2...N+1: Numbers in the sequence

SAMPLE INPUT:

12
4
2
1
3
7
4
2
9
11
6
8
4

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Single integer that is the size of the longest increasing
          subsequence

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
5

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The longest increasing subsequence is 2 3 4 6 8.
1 3 4 6 8 is another one.
