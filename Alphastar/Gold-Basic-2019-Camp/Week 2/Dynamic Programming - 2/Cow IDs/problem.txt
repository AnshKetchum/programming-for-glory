Cow IDs
=======

Being a secret computer geek, Farmer John labels all of his cows with
binary numbers.  However, he is a bit superstitious, and only labels 
cows with binary numbers that have exactly K "1" bits (1 <= K <= 10).  
The leading bit of each label is always a "1" bit, of course.  FJ 
assigns labels in increasing numeric order, starting from the smallest 
possible valid label -- a K-bit number consisting of all "1" bits.
Unfortunately, he loses track of his labeling and needs your help: 
please determine the Nth label he should assign (1 <= N <= 10^7).

PROBLEM NAME: cowids

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.

SAMPLE INPUT:

7 3

INPUT DETAILS:

Among all binary numbers containing exactly 3 "1" bits, FJ wants 
to output the 7th in increasing sorted order.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Only a single line; the binary number that is Nth in 
increasing order among the numbers with K "1" bits.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

10110
