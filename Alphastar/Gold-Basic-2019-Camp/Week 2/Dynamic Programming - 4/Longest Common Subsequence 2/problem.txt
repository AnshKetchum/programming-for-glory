Longest Common Subsequence 2
============================

Given two strings s1 and s2 (0 < |s1|,|s2| <= 10000) find the size of 
their longest common subsequence. Strings can only be composed of 
lowercase and uppercase letters. A subsequence is a sequence that 
appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. 

PROBLEM NAME: lcs2

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: s1

* Line 2: s2

SAMPLE INPUT:

abrcadambracaaaa
tdabraccasaa

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Single integer that is the size of the longest common
          subsequence

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

9

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The longest common subsequence is 'dabracaaa' as shown below:

abrcadambrac a aaa
t    da braccasaa

Note that there might be different subsequences.
