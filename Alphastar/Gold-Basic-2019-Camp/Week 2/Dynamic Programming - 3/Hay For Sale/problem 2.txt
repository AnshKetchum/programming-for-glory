Hay For Sale
============

Farmer John suffered a terrible loss when giant Australian cockroaches ate
the entirety of his hay inventory, leaving him with nothing to feed the
cows. He hitched up his wagon with capacity C (1 <= C <= 50,000) cubic units
and sauntered over to Farmer Don's to get some hay before the cows miss a meal.

Farmer Don had a wide variety of H (1 <= H <= 5,000) hay bales for
sale, each with its own volume (1 <= V_i <= C). Bales of hay, you
know, are somewhat flexible and can be jammed into the oddest of
spaces in a wagon.

FJ carefully evaluates the volumes so that he can figure out the
largest amount of hay he can purchase for his cows.

Given the volume constraint and a list of bales to buy, what is the
greatest volume of hay FJ can purchase?  He can't purchase partial
bales, of course.
