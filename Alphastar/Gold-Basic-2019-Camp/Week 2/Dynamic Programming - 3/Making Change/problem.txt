Making Change
=============

Poor Bessie has taken a job in the convenience store located just
over the border in Slobbovia. Slobbovians use different coinages
than the USA; their coin values change day-by-day!
 
Help Bessie make optimal change for Slobbovian shoppers. You will
need to create C (1 <= C <= 1000) cents of change using N (1 <= N
<= 10) coins of various values. All test cases will be solvable
using the supplied coins.

If 5 coins of values 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 were available, Bessie
would make optimum change (minimal coins) of 93 cents by using 1 x
50, 1 x 25, 1 x 10, 1 x 5, and 3 x 1 coins (a total of 7 coins).
 
How hard could it be? The final two test cases will be challenging.

PROBLEM NAME: change

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separate integers: C and N

* Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains a single unique integer that is a
        coin value that can be used to create change

SAMPLE INPUT:

93 5
25
50
10
1
5

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer that is the minimum number of coins to
        create C cents

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

7
