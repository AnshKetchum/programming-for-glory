Cow Roller Coaster
==================

The cows are building a roller coaster! They want your help to
design as fun a roller coaster as possible, while keeping to the
budget.

The roller coaster will be built on a long linear stretch of land
of length L (1 <= L <= 1,000). The roller coaster comprises a
collection of some of the N (1 <= N <= 10,000) different interchangable
components. Each component i has a fixed length Wi (1 <= Wi <= L).
Due to varying terrain, each component i can be only built starting
at location Xi (0 <= Xi <= L-Wi). The cows want to string together
various roller coaster components starting at 0 and ending at L so
that the end of each component (except the last) is the start of
the next component.

Each component i has a "fun rating" Fi (1 <= Fi <= 1,000,000) and
a cost Ci (1 <= Ci <= 1000). The total fun of the roller coster is
the sum of the fun from each component used; the total cost is
likewise the sum of the costs of each component used. The cows'
total budget is B (1 <= B <= 1000). Help the cows determine the
most fun roller coaster that they can build with their budget.

PROBLEM NAME: coaster

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: L, N and B.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains four space-separated integers,
        respectively: Xi, Wi, Fi, and Ci.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 6 10
0 2 20 6
2 3 5 6
0 1 2 1
1 1 1 3
1 2 5 4
3 2 10 2


OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer that is the maximum fun value that a
        roller-coaster can have while staying within the budget and
        meeting all the other constraints. If it is not possible to
        build a roller-coaster within budget, output -1.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

17

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Taking the 3rd, 5th and 6th components gives a connected roller-coaster
with fun value 17 and cost 7. Taking the first two components would
give a more fun roller-coaster (25) but would be over budget.
