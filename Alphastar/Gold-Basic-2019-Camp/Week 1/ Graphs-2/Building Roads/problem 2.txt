Building Roads
==============

Farmer John had just acquired several new farms! He wants to connect 
the farms with roads so that he can travel from any farm to any other 
farm via a sequence of roads; roads already connect some of the farms.

Each of the N (1 <= N <= 1,000) farms (conveniently numbered 1..N) 
is represented by a position (Xi, Yi) on the plane 
(0 <= Xi <= 1,000,000; 0 <= Yi <= 1,000,000). 
Given the preexisting M roads (1 <= M <= 1,000) as pairs of connected 
farms, help Farmer John determine the smallest length of additional 
roads he must build to connect all his farms.

PROBLEM NAME: roads

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M

* Lines 2..N+1: Two space-separated integers: Xi and Yi

* Lines N+2..N+M+2: Two space-separated integers: i and j, indicating 
	that there is already a road connecting the farm i and farm j.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 1
1 1
3 1
2 3
4 3
1 4

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Smallest length of additional roads required to connect 
	all farms, printed without rounding to two decimal places. 
	Be sure to calculate distances as 64-bit floating point numbers.


SAMPLE OUTPUT:

4.00
