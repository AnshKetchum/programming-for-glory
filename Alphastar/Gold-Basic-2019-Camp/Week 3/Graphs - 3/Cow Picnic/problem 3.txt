Cow Picnic
==========

The cows are having a picnic! Each of Farmer John's K (1 <= K <= 100) 
cows is grazing in one of N (1 <= N <= 1,000) pastures, conveniently 
numbered 1...N. The pastures are connected by M (1 <= M <= 10,000) 
one-way paths (no path connects a pasture to itself).

The cows want to gather in the same pasture for their picnic, but 
(because of the one-way paths) some cows may only be able to get to 
some pastures. Help the cows out by figuring out how many pastures 
are reachable by all cows, and hence are possible picnic locations.

PROBLEM NAME: picnic

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers, respectively: K, N, and M

* Lines 2..K+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer (1..N) 
	which is the number of the pasture in which cow i is grazing.

* Lines K+2..M+K+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers, 
	respectively A and B (both 1..N and A != B), representing 
	a one-way path from pasture A to pasture B.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2 4 4
2
3
1 2
1 4
2 3
3 4

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The single integer that is the number of pastures 
	that are reachable by all cows via the one-way paths.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The cows can meet in pastures 3 or 4.
