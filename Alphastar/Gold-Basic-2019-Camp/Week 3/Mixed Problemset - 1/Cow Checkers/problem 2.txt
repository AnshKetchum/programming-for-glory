Cow Checkers
============

One day, Bessie decides to challenge Farmer John to a game of 'Cow
Checkers'. The game is played on an M*N (1 <= M <= 1,000,000; 1 <=
N <= 1,000,000) checkerboard that initially contains a single checker
piece on the checkboard square coordinates (X, Y) (0 <= X < M; 0
<= Y < N). The bottom leftmost square of the checkerboard has
coordinates (0, 0), and the top rightmost square has coordinates
(M-1, N-1). Bessie always moves first, and then the two players
alternate turns.  Each turn comprises one of three types of moves:

1) Move the checker piece to any square on the same row to the left
   of its current position.

2) Move the checker piece to any square on the same column below its
   current position.

3) Move the checker piece to any spot k squares below and k squares
   to the left of the current square (where k is any positive integer
   such that this new spot is still on the checkerboard).

The first player unable to make a move (i.e., because the checker
is at (0, 0)) loses. Given that Bessie always goes first, determine
who will win the game if both play optimally.

Play and report the winner for T games (1 <= T <= 1,000) reading
in a new X,Y starting value for each new game.

PROBLEM NAME: cowcheck

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: M and N

* Line 2: A single integer: T

* Lines 3..T+2: Two space-separated integers: X and Y

SAMPLE INPUT:

3 3
1
1 1

INPUT DETAILS:

Farmer John and Bessie are playing one game on a 3*3 checkerboard with the 
checker piece initially at (1, 1) (i.e. at the center of the board).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..T: Should contain either "Farmer John" or "Bessie"
        depending on who wins each  game.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

Bessie

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie initially can only move the checker piece to either (1, 0) or (0, 
1), or (0, 0). Bessie can immediately win by moving the piece to (0, 0).
